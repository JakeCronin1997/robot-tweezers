# Overview

The A4988 is a microstepping driver for controlling stepper motors. A4988 is widely used because of its versatility; we can control the stepper motor with just 2 pins from our controller: 1 for controlling rotation, 1 for controlling steps.

The driver provides 5 different step resolutions: 
- full-step
- 1/2-step
- 1/4-step
- 1/8-step
- 1/16-step

Our controller (Arduino) supplies 5V for the driver. Everything else is standard, excpet the fact that we might need a capacitor with at least 47µF capacitance to protec the driver board from voltage spikes.

MS1, MS2, and MS3 pins are used for selecting one of the five step resolutions according to the above truth table. If they are left disconnected, the board will operate in full step mode

# Example Circuit Schematic

Since MS1, MS2, MS3 are disconnected, we are in full step mode. Direction and Step pins of the driver are connected to pin 3 and 4 on the Arduino, as well as the ground and 5V pins. Do not forget to add a capacitor with F > 47µF to avoid the board from failing.

# Example Code
```c
/*     Prototype motor control example code
 *     Author: Chaewoon Song
 *     Date: November 23rd 2021

 */
 
// define which pins to use
const int stepPin = 3; 
const int dirPin = 4; 

// stepper motor assumed to have 1.8 degrees step angle
// 1 full cycle = 360 deg ==> 1.8 * 200 = 360 deg
// therefore the below for loop will give you one full cycle
#define stepsPerRevolution

// in the setup funciton, set the above pins as outputs
void setup() {
  pinMode(stepPin,OUTPUT); 
  pinMode(dirPin,OUTPUT);
}

// the "main" function
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(dirPin,HIGH); 
  
  // stepper motor assumed to have 1.8 degrees step angle
  // 1 full cycle = 360 deg ==> 1.8 * 200 = 360 deg
  // therefore the below for loop will give you one full cycle
  for(int x = 0; x < stepsPerRevolution; x++) {
    digitalWrite(stepPin,HIGH); 
    delayMicroseconds(500); 
    digitalWrite(stepPin,LOW); 
    delayMicroseconds(500); 
  }
  delay(1000); // One second delay
  
  // by changing it to "LOW" you should see a change in direction
  digitalWrite(dirPin,LOW);
  
  // again see the full rotation, this time in the other direction
  for(int x = 0; x < stepsPerRevolution; x++) {
    digitalWrite(stepPin,HIGH);
    delayMicroseconds(500);
    digitalWrite(stepPin,LOW);
    delayMicroseconds(500);
  }
  delay(1000);
}
```

It looks like in order to control multiple stepper motors smoothly, the standard is to use the library "AccelStepper"
